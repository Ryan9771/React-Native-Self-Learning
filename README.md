## React-Native-Intro
This project is an informal 'notes app' that I made to learn the basics of react native.

## Features
- This project is mainly for note taking, and as a result, you will see plain text note files, and comments along the way.
- The `.js` screens in the directory `Screens/` do not entirely relate to each other, as each directory in `Screens/` is for a certain area of react native that I have learnt.
- Feel free to check out what I have learnt / am learning by looking in the `Screens/` directory, or reading the `notes`

(**Note**: This project is purely for my self learning, and strongly recommend reading the docs for a in depth guide)
